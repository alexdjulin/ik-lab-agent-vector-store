    "The recommended method for doing so is to create a `RetrievalQA` and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

The Ruff linter is compatible with Black out-of-the-box, as\\nlong as the line-length setting is consistent between the two.\\nRuff is designed to be used alongside a formatter (like Ruff's own formatter, or Black) and, as\\nsuch, will defer implementing stylistic rules that are obviated by automated formatting.\\nNote that Ruff's linter and Black treat line-length enforcement a little differently. Black, like\\nRuff's formatter, makes a best-effort attempt to adhere to the\\nline-length, but avoids automatic line-wrapping in some cases (e.g.,\\nwithin comments). Ruff, on the other hand, will flag line-too-long\\n(E501) for any line that exceeds the line-length setting. As such, if\\nline-too-long (E501) is enabled, Ruff can still trigger line-length\\nviolations even when Black or ruff format is enabled.\\nHow does Ruff's formatter compare to Black?\\nThe Ruff formatter is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Black.\\nSpecifically, the formatter is intended to emit near-identical output when run over Black-formatted\\ncode. When run over extensive Black-formatted projects like Django and Zulip, > 99.9% of lines\\nare formatted identically. When migrating an existing project from Black to Ruff, you should expect\\nto see a few differences on the margins, but the vast majority of your code should be unchanged.\\nWhen run over non-Black-formatted code, the formatter makes some different decisions than Black,\\nand so more deviations should be expected, especially around the treatment of end-of-line comments.\\nSee Black compatibility for more.\\nHow does Ruff's linter compare to Flake8?\\nRuff can be used as a drop-in replacement for Flake8 when used (1) without or with a small number of\\nplugins, (2) alongside Black, and (3) on Python 3 code.\\nUnder those conditions, Ruff implements every rule in Flake8. In practice, that means Ruff\\nimplements all of the F rules (which originate from Pyflakes), along with a subset of the E and\\nW rules (which originate from pycodestyle).\\nRuff also re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code quality tools\\nnatively, including:\"),\n",

For example, Ruff uses TID252 to represent the I252 rule from\\nflake8-tidy-imports. This helps minimize conflicts across plugins and allows any individual plugin\\nto be toggled on or off with a single (e.g.) --select TID, as opposed to --select I2 (to avoid\\nconflicts with the isort rules, like I001).\\nBeyond the rule set, Ruff\\'s primary limitation vis-Ã -vis Flake8 is that it does not support custom\\nlint rules. (Instead, popular Flake8 plugins are re-implemented in Rust as part of Ruff itself.)\\nOne minor difference is that Ruff doesn\\'t include all the \\'opinionated\\' rules from flake8-bugbear.\\nHow does Ruff\\'s linter compare to Pylint?\\nAt time of writing, Pylint implements ~409 total rules, while Ruff implements over 800, of which at\\nleast 209 overlap with the Pylint rule set (see: #970).\\nPylint implements many rules that Ruff does not, and vice versa. For example, Pylint does more type\\ninference than Ruff (e.g., Pylint can validate the number of arguments in a function call). As such,\\nRuff is not a \"pure\" drop-in replacement for Pylint (and vice versa), as they enforce different sets\\nof rules.\\nDespite these differences, many users have successfully switched from Pylint to Ruff, especially\\nthose using Ruff alongside a type checker,\\nwhich can cover some of the functionality that Pylint provides.\\nLike Flake8, Pylint supports plugins (called \"checkers\"), while Ruff implements all rules natively\\nand does not support custom or third-party rules. Unlike Pylint, Ruff is capable of automatically\\nfixing its own lint violations.\\nIn some cases, Ruff\\'s rules may yield slightly different results than their Pylint counterparts. For\\nexample, Ruff\\'s too-many-branches does not count try blocks as\\ntheir own branches, unlike Pylint\\'s R0912. Ruff\\'s PL rule group also includes a small number of\\nrules from Pylint extensions (like magic-value-comparison),\\nwhich need to be explicitly activated when using Pylint. By enabling Ruff\\'s PL group, you may\\nsee violations for rules that weren\\'t previously enabled through your Pylint configuration.\\nPylint parity is being tracked in #970.\\nHow does Ruff compare to Mypy, or Pyright, or Pyre?\\nRuff is a linter, not a type checker. It can detect some of the same problems that a type checker\\ncan, but a type checker will catch certain errors that Ruff would miss. The opposite is also true:\\nRuff will catch certain errors that a type checker would typically ignore.\\nFor example, unlike a type checker, Ruff will notify you if an import is unused, by looking for\\nreferences to that import in the source code; on the other hand, a type checker could flag that you\\npassed an integer argument to a function that expects a string, which Ruff would miss. The\\ntools are complementary.\\nIt\\'s recommended that you use Ruff in conjunction with a type checker, like Mypy, Pyright, or Pyre,\\nwith Ruff providing faster feedback on lint violations and the type checker providing more detailed\\nfeedback on type errors.\\nWhich tools does Ruff replace?\\nToday, Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 when used with any of the following plugins:'),\n",
